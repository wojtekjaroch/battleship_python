# Battleship Game

## Introduction
Drawing inspiration from the classic era of naval warfare, this Battleship project dares players to strategically deploy their fleet and take aim at their adversary's ships. The game seamlessly combines elements of strategy, deduction, and a touch of luck, creating an enthralling experience tailored for two players.

## Project Description
This iteration of Battleship introduces players to a turn-based naval showdown. The gameplay unfolds in two distinct phases: a placement phase where players strategically position their ships on a grid, followed by a shooting phase where they endeavor to locate and sink their adversary's fleet. Beyond delivering a classic Battleship encounter, this game boasts additional features such as customizable board sizes and the option to face off against AI opponents.
